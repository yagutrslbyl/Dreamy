## Local Development (Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed

### Run locally

Docker Compose starts both MySQL and the app with a single command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yagutrslbyl/Dreamy.git
cd dreamy
docker compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Stop everything

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Spring Profiles

| Profile | Database | Used for |
|---------|----------|----------|
| default | MySQL on localhost:3306 | Local development |
| test | H2 in-memory | Integration tests |
| prod | PostgreSQL (Render) | Cloud deployment |

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push or PR to `main`:

1. Checkout code
2. Set up Java 17
3. Cache Maven dependencies
4. Run `mvn clean verify` (builds + runs all tests with H2)

The pipeline status is shown as a badge on the repo.

---

## Deployment (Render)

### Step 1 — Create a PostgreSQL Database

1. Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click "New +" → select **PostgreSQL**
3. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | dreamy-db |
| Region | e.g. Frankfurt (EU Central) — note it for Step 2 |
| PostgreSQL Version | 16 |

4. Click "Create Database" and wait until status is **Available**
5. Copy the **Internal Database URL** — you'll need it in Step 2

> ⚠️ **Important:** the database and the web service must be deployed to the **same region**. Render's internal networking only works within a region.

### Step 2 — Deploy the Web Service

1. Click "New +" → select **Web Service**
2. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
3. Configure:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | dreamy |
| Region | Same as your database |
| Environment | Docker |
| Dockerfile Path | ./Dockerfile |

4. Under the **"Environment"** tab, add:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| DATABASE_URL | from Render DB |
| DB_USERNAME | from Render DB |
| DB_PASSWORD | from Render DB |
| SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE | prod |

5. Click "Create Web Service"

### Auto-deploys

Every push to `main` triggers a new build and deploy automatically.
